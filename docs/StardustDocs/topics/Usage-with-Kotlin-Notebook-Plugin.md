# Usage with Kotlin Notebook Plugin

The [Kotlin Notebook Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16340-kotlin-notebook), combined with Kotlin DataFrame, offers powerful data analysis capabilities within an interactive environment. Here are key features:

- **Visual Data Exploration**: View and navigate through your data using paginated tables. Drill down into nested data if your DataFrame contains nested structures.
- **Intuitive Sorting**: Sort data with a single click on column headers, facilitating rapid data organization and analysis.
- **Convenient Data Copying**: Copy data from tables for use in other tools or analyses.
- **Export Functionality**: Export your data to various formats including CSV and Excel for further analysis in other applications.

To get started, ensure you have the latest version of the Kotlin Notebook Plugin installed in IntelliJ IDEA, and begin exploring your data using Kotlin DataFrames in your notebook cells.
