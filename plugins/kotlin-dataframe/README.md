## :plugins:kotlin-dataframe

This module, published as "compiler-plugin-all", holds the Kotlin 2.x Compiler plugin of DataFrame.

A [work-in-progress](https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe/issues/704)
plugin for your Gradle project that can generate on-the-fly column accessors for the compiler and IDE even without
having to provide data schemas!

Details of how to build and run this for yourself will follow, but there is a
[demo project](https://github.com/koperagen/df-plugin-demo) you can try already.
